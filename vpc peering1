                    vpc peering


Step 1 : create a vpc (Myvpc)  - 10.0.0.0/16
Step2 : create two subnets

Subnet1 –10.0.1.0/24
Subnet1 –10.0.2.0/24
Step 3:  Enable public ip to subnet1
Step4: Create  internet gateway ,and attach to vpc  ---MYIGW
Step5: Create Route table ---MYRT
Step6: Attach Route table to subnet1
Step7: Attach Route table to internet gateway
Now,subnet1 is public.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Now let,s launch webserver in public subnet.(subnet1)
Services --- > Ec2--- Launch instance ---step3 Network:  Myvpc
                                                                                 Subnet:10.0.1.0/24   

Additional Details –user data

Add rule
Type               Source
Ssh                Anywhere
http              Anywhere
Launch the instance.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lets launch the database server in private subnet.
Services – Ec2 –Launch instance –step3 : Network : MYvpc
                                                                         DbSubnet : 10.0.2.0/24
Name tag :Dbserver –Next—securiyt group : Dbsg ,description : Dbsg
Change the type from ssh to Mysql/Aurora
Type                              source         
Mysql/Aurora             custom      10.0.0.0/24 (web server subnet value)
Keypair :DBsg.pem
Review and Launch
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Now ,web server  can pull data from database server
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
DBA wants to create some file . wants to perfome some maintenance activitys. Can he correct? 
AS DB server is not having public ip and it is not having internet connectivity.DBA cannot connect.
For this ,we need to create Bastion server / jump server in public subnet
It is nothing but normal Ec2-machine

Services –Ec2 –Launch –Amazon linux --- select Myvpc ---select subnet1(websubnet)
(it means bastion server in public)
 Name : Bastion server 
Security group : Bastion-sg
Description : Bastion sg
(ssh port ------should be open to myself)
Type                                           source
Ssh                                               Myip   ( 157.47.124.46/32)
Keypairname: Bationkey
 Review and launch 
Now only I can connect to bastion server  through  SSH
From the bastion server ,I should  able to jump in to db server
That means ,DB server SSH port should be open to bastion server .
Go to DB server security group – DB sg (new tab)
Select the DBSG  ---INBOUND ROULES ---  Edit—ADD rule
Type                                      source      
SSH                                        custom    10.0.1.53/32  (private ip of bastion server)
Now let’s test can we connect  to DB server 
In EC2-dash board --- select bastion server ---connect  with putty only.
Then                        sudo su 
                                Yum update -y
Imp note : From bastion server ---we need to jump to DB server.
Select DB server – connect 
Copy the entire SSH command .
As We are connecting to linux to linux .pem file is enough
Enter the SSH command in putty .
Eg .  # ssh –i “DBserver.pem”ec2-user@10.0.2.106
Note : to connect the .pem file need to be present in present working directory.
Now, we need to copy DBSERVER.pem file.
It is there in our windows machine.
We use WINSCP  to transfer the file from windows to linux.
In Google serarch for  ‘’WINSCP’’
Winscp.net
Download and run 
Open WINSCP
We will connect to bastion server using WINSCP
Host name :  user @ipaddress
Ex: ec2-user@ 3.83.161.42
Advanced  -- authentication  -- private keyfile   -- select the ppk file  0f(bastion server)  ---–open –ok –login
Now,drag and drop the pem file of DB.PEM--- > to bastion server .
In putty 
# ls  (we should able to see the file )
Now connect  to DB server by running the SSH command 
#ssh- i “DBserver.pem”ec2-user@10.0.2.106
You are now connected to DBserver!!!!!
NOW ,IN db server ,lets execute the following commands.
$ sudo su
Now I want to upgrade the mysql data base 
Command to upgrade mysql database
Yum install mysql –y
Not successful 
We cannot install ,as we are not having internet connection to private subnet.
To get internet connection ,we create NAT server.(Network  Address translator)
The purpose of NAT is to provide internet to private subnet.
We need to create NAT in public subnet.
IN vpc dashboard
NATGATEWAYs --- > Create NAT GATEWAY—name --MyNATGATE
Subnet:10.0.1.0/24(public subnet)
Create new EPI  (or) Allocate IP --- > create a NAT GATEWAY --- > close.
NAT need 2 min approx. to get created.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
What is Elastic ip?
It is similar to public ip
When we stop and start the Ec2 machines, public ip will change .
If you start and stop the machine, you want the same public ip ,then we create a Elastic ip .
Elastic ip is nothing but static public ip.
Why do we need Elastic ip  to NAT.
If incase NAT is down ,entire private subnet will not to get internet.
Then we restart the NAT again,then it acquire new public ip
When NAT acquire new public ip ,there could be connection issue.
So we need Elastic ip to NAT
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
NAT is a closed box .it does not have any ports concept.
So ,no one can connect the NAT.
We cannot connect NAT to private subnet directly.
So ,we create Routetable.
One end of Routetable is ,I connect to NAT.
Another end of the Route table ,I connect to the private subnet.
Instead of creating new route table,we can use default route table which was created vpc.
Lets change the name of default route table to---- > NATROUTE
OR Create a new route table
Select the  NATROUTE -- > subnet association ---Edit subnet association –select private subnet or DB subnet--- save
Select NATROUTE ---Routes---Edit routes  ---- Add route---Target : NATGATE WAY(select  NAT)
Destination ---   0.0.0.0/0      NATGATE way ---save route – close.
Now ,lets test are we able to get internet to our DBserver.
Run the same command in putty again.
# yum install mysql –y

It works !!!!!
Deletion process :
Step1 : Delete NAT
Step2 : Delete  EC2 Machine
Step3: Delete vpc
Step4: Release Elastic ip (select Elastic ip  from dashboard –action –Release Address0 ) 
 
 Chapter 2: before going to create a NACL copy webserver ip & paste it in google.  “  Mygoogle  “    will found.
Network ACL    (NACL)

Security group will provide security at instance level   
NACL will provide security at subnet level.
Creating   NACL
Select Network ACL ----- we have two default NACL
One for default vpc ---
One for my vpc  
(so whenever we create new vpc ,by default NACL is created automatically)
We will create  a new NACL  and attach to public subnet.
Create Network ACL ---Name tag :public NACL
Vpc : myvpc
Create 
Select the public NACL ---Subnet Association---Edit subnet association ---select public subnet(websubnet).
Edit 

Now try to access the webserver
We cannot get web page!!!!!!
We need to open ports at NACL
Inbound rules---Edit inbound rules ---Add rule
Rule#    type                   source
 100       ssh                      157.47.113.215/32  (my ip)
200         HTTP                  0.0.0.0/0   htttp poen to all

 Now try to access the webserver
 We cannot get web page!!!!!!
Lets select websecurity group ---inbound tab  ---edit
Did we Add port in outbound tab ?
In security group ,when we open inbound port ,by default outbound port is open to all.
This status is called statefull.
So,we have opened HTTP incoming, by default outbound port Is open to all.Hence we able to access the server .
This status is called statefull.
For NACL ,the case is different.
We need to open outbound port NACL  explicitly.
So, NACL is stateless.
Select NACL   ---outbound Rules  -- Edit outbound Rules ---Add Rule
Rule#        type                   source
100           ssh                      157.47.113.215/32  (my ip)
200           HTTP                   0.0.0.0/0   htttp poen to all
Now,  can we able to  access webserver
No!!!!!

Ephemeral ports:
Total Range of ports : 0 to  65535
Range 1024 -65535 are the range of ephemeral
Search in Google  “ephemeral ports in  AWS ”,we can see the   range
Assume in public subnet ,we have 100 webserver 
All are connected to load balancer .
If hacker is  block any http port on 1 webserver 
Will  it be a problem?
No!!!
As load balancer will send the request to other servers.
If hacker blocks any http port on NACL level (subnet level)
Entire website is down.
To avoid  thois problem ,AWS is providing range of ports (1024-65535)
We need to open this range in NACL level .
So when hacker blocks a particular port (HTTP), AWS uses  a random port from the range 
AWS will replace the random as HTTP port .
So that website will never godown.
Note : Ephermeral ports are mandatory at NACL level 
Select  --- publicNACL  --Inbound --- Edit inbound rule ---Add rule

Rule                   Type                               portRange
300                     Custom tcp Rule             1024-65535
Save.
Now , can we able to access  webserver ?
No !!!!
NACL are stateless. We need to open ports in outbound level also.
Select  --- publicNACL  --Inbound --- Edit inbound rule ---Add rule

Rule                   Type                               portRange
300                     Custom tcp Rule             1024-65535
Save
Now , can we able to access  webserver ?
yes !!!!

what is the use of NACL ?
Rule                     type 
200                       HTTP        (we have open to all)
Add ONE MORE RULE
Rule                     type               allow /deny
201                       HTTP             Deny   
Save.
Similarly
Select  our NACL -----outbound rues
Rule                     type 
200                       HTTP        (we have open to all)
Add ONE MORE RULE
Rule                     type               allow /deny
201                       HTTP             Deny   
Save.
Now !! are we able to access the web server
Yes!!!!
Conclusion !Lowest rule# will have highest priority.
Now,inbound rules
Rule# ---201 change to 199
Save.
Now,outbound rules
Rule# ---201 change to 199
Save.
Now ,Lowest rule is 199 which is deny
So ,we connot access the web server

Use causes:
Hacker is continuously accessing the webserver .
We want to black the his ip ,but the other customers should be able to accesss the webserver .
 How can I do it .
Lets Assume ,iam the hacker 
Now ,in bound rules,change the source

Rule#                                        source
199                                           157.47.113.215/32
(net work team will give us incoming request ip address)
Similarly outbound rules also
Now,are we able to access the webserver 
No!!!(as it is blocked my machine)
Imp usecauses: BY USING NACL ,WE CAN BLOCK SPECIFIC IP ADDRESS
 NOW 
Lets delete the rule#199 from inbond and outbound level
  Now,are we able to access the webserver 
   Yes !!! 
NACL IS NOT RECOMMANDED  TO USE  FOR PRIVATE SUBNETS.

Deletion process :
Step1 : Delete NAT
Step2 : Delete  EC2 Machine
Step3: Delete vpc
Step4: Release Elastic ip (select Elastic ip  from dashboard –action –Release Address0 ) 
Step5: Delete  NACL
