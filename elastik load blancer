                                               LOAD BALANCER
      A Load blancer is accepts incoming traffic from clients and routes requests to Ec2-instance. (targets)
      The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensure that it route traffic only to health targets.
      When the load balancer detects  an unhealthy targets , it stops routing  traffic to   target . it then resumes routing traffic to that target when it detects that the target is healthy again.
Step :1 Create a linux machine
Launch  instance --- amazon linux ---no.of instance -1 ----subnet –souteast-1a    –name tag -webserver-1 -----security group—mysecurity group
Then open the two ports 
1. ssh                        22                 anywere
2. http                      80                anywere
Then launch
Step 2: Acces the machine
Step 3: run the commands to install web package
sudo –i
yum update –y
yum install httpd -y 
cd /var/www/html
echo “webserver-1” > index.html
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on

step 5: Access the webserver by using public ip or DNS
step 6: launch one more linux machine and install web package
Launch  instance --- amazon linux ---no of instance -1 ----subnet –souteast-1b    –name tag -webserver-2  -----security group—mysecurity group
 ---step important : Advance details –user data
  #!/bin/bash
  sudo su 
  yum update –y
  yum install httpd -y 
  cd /var/www/html
  echo “webserver-2” > index.html
  service httpd start
  chkconfig httpd on

  ls
tags   –webserver-2  ---securitygroup----mysecuritygroup – it will open the ssh and http ports.
Step 7 : Create a load blancer
Selecte the classic load blancer
     Loadblancer Name --- loadbalancer –next –LB INSIDE ---MYVPC-----select the subnets1a&1b exactly what we need,TARGET GROUP NAME--------Mytarget123-----selecte the  exisiting security group –next –step 4:
Advance details :
Response Time out  - 2 seconds
Interval  -- 5 seconds
Unhealthy threshold -2
Healthy threshold -   2
Next --- Attach the both subnets
Next --- Attach the both instances
Next  --- next   ---create 
Step 8: lets verify the 2nd instance manually
Select the public ip & paste in browser
Step 9: Access the load blancer by using DNS
Example: myload-1887706558.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com
And experience the load balancer.
Step 10 : if one server is down,it should redirect the traffic to another server .
1)	Then we can stop/terminate the machine
2)	Remove the file / rename  the file
