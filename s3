Storge --------------> S3
Lets delete the existing bucket
•	Create a new bucket
Bucket name ---- > version --- > vardhan917758
Region  -mumbai
Next ----Next ---- ---- > un check Block  all public access
Next   --- create Bucket

How to enable versioning
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Click on the bucket ---------- > properties tab
(observation : By default version is disable)
EDIT -------  >  Enable
Save changes

Lets upload on the object
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Creat sample.txt ,content of the file let it be  “my first line”
Upload the file ------>Next----- > grant public access ---->Next--->next

First Advantage of versioning
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 We can recover deleted object
Lets delete the object .
Select the check box --- > Action ----- > delete 

How can we recover 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Enable list version
We can see the object and delete marker.
Note :  when we delete ,object is not delete.
             It is marked as deleted.
So ,if you remove the delete marker ,we will get object .
Select the delete marker check box ------ > Actions ---- > Delete ----> 
Now disable list version
Our object is back !!!

2nd Advantage we can maintain different versions of the file.
Open the same file in the desktop
Add another line “this is second line” 
Upload the same file again .
Get the object URL, and check from the browser.we get the latest file.


     Where can we see the older version of file.?
 
Show the list version
We can see the both versions 
And we can download the older version of the file .
Even if you delete the file  , we can recover  the both versions.
Select the object ---- > action ---> delete ---- > delete
Select the show button .
We can see the both versions of the file .
If you delete individual versions , we cannot recover.
Note : if you delete the bucket ,we cannot recover.
Lets delete the bucket.
Now, the dash board is empty.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Static website hosting
 
Lets create a bukcket
Bucket name --- bucket456478
Next ------ Next ----- > uncheck block  all public access  -- ----                   Next   -- >   create a bucket 

Select the bucket ----- >properties --- >static website hosting 
---- >  Edit --- > Enable ---- > Host a static website ----
Index  document     ---  index.html
Error document   ------- error.html
Save 
Now ,we need to create index.html and error.html 
In this index.html file 
<h1>welcome to my site </h1> 
And the error.html file
<h1>site under construction </h1>
then two servers are upload in created bucket ----- > (bucket456478)
Note : make it public.(permission ---ACL –(every one) public access)
Now ,go to the properties of the bucket  --- > static website hosting ---  > get URL of the website (end point)
Note : individual file should have public Access.

what is the use of error.html?
incase of  any reason, if index.html is not accessible 
then error page will be displayed.

Lets make the index.html page as private.
Select  index.html --- > ACL ------ > Edit ---- > public Access --- >  --read --- > uncheck --- > save changes

Now, refresh the URL ,we get error.html page !!!!
Lets , delete the files ---- and delete the bucket .

CRR    (cross region replication)
Lets say two buckets (1st  bucket in Mumbai 2nd bucket in sydney region )
We upload the object in Mumbai, the object should also be available in sydney.
As we are replicating the  object in another region, it is called cross region replication .
Vice-versa will not happend.
If we delete the object in Mumbai, it will not deleted in sydney .
If we edit  the object in Mumbai, it will not edited in sydney .
Lets create bucket 
Bucket name --- Mumbai-sfddhhdh
Region –   Mumbai 
Next --- > Next  --- > uncheck block all public access
Next ---- > create bucket .

Lets create 2nd   bucket 
Bucket name --- sydny-sfddhhdh
Region –   sydney
Next --- > Next  --- > uncheck block all public access
Next ---- > create bucket .
Enable cross region replication in Mumbai.
Select Mumbai bucket --- > management -- > replication  rules --- > create a replication rules --- > Enable bucket versioning ---- > replication rule name --- > CRR1
Destination bucket --- > Sydney bucket  -- > Enable versioning -- > IAM role--- >
 (to establish connection between two region, we need role ) 
 IAM ROLE  -- create a new role
Save .
Lets upload object in Mumbai bucket ,it  will be replicated in sydney bucket .

Transfer Acceleration 
When we Enable transfer Acceleration ,data will be transferred to the Edge location and then from Edge location data will be transferred to the bucket.
Select the Mumbai bucket --- > properties --- > Transfer acceleration --- > EDIT --- > Enable  -- >    save changes.
  
HOW CAN WE CHECK THE SPEED
Properties ---- transfer acceleration  ---- > Learn more 
Amazon s3 transfer acceleration speed comparision  tool
