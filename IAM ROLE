         IAM (  Identity  And  Access  management)
IAM 
------------------
It’s  related to administration.
AWS identity  and access management ( IAM ) is a service that helps you securely control access to Aws resources . you use IAM to control who is authorized(permissions) to use resources .
When you first  create  an Aws account ,it has complete access to all Aws services . this identity is called  the AWS account root user .
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Every company will have only one AWS Account .
Owner of the account,can  create user account .
We can give limited privileges to user account .
Ex :
User  A ----- > should   have  Ec2  full   Access 
User  B ------ > should  have   s3  full   Access
User C ----- > should have EC2 read only access 
Using  IAM ,we can 
1)	Create  users.
2)	Create groups.
3)	Assing permissions to the users and  groups.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
As  All of our created aws account .
That mean ,we started using IAM service.
By default ,we are all adminisitrators.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lets login to aws account.
Service ------ >security,identity and compliance -- IAM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lets create a user.

Then go to users ----- > Add user --- > user name --- > RAVI  --- >
Access type ---we select both
                              Programmatic     Access
                             AWS management console Access
                            Custom paswd ----Ravi123@

NOTE :  -  We  are not select the reset passwd (remove the tick mark) 

                                                        ------- > Next:permissions
We select Attach existing policies

Then we need AmazonEC2FullAccess
NEXT---- > next --- > create user

Then again create a new user called   LATHA

Then go to users ----- > Add user --- > user name --- > LATHA --- >
Access type ---we select both
                              Programmatic     Access
                             AWS management console Access
                            Custom paswd ----Latha123@

NOTE :  -  We  are not select the reset passwd (remove the tick mark)

                                                        ------- > Next:permissions
We select Attach existing policies

Then we need AmazonS3FullAccess 
NEXT---- > next --- > create user


Account id :
                       RAVI
                       ravi123@
                     
                        LATHA
                        Latha123@

Then signout     the           Amazon account        &      sign in again 
long with -----IAM USER
               
                              Account id : 432970265736
                              IAM USER NAME : RAVI
                              PASSWORD :    Ravi123@

He can have a EC2 full access only 
The create  a EC2 instance 
But he cannot create a s3 bucket because he didn’t have any other permissions.
  
Then signout     the           Amazon account        &      sign in again 
long with -----IAM USER
               
                              Account id : 432970265736
                              IAM USER NAME:   LATHA
                              PASSWORD :   Latha123@
He can have a s3 full access only 
The create  a s3 bucket 
But he cannot create a EC2 instanse because he didn’t have any other permissions.



Let’s try
Existing user can have two permissons (add one more policies)
Then select the user (ravi or latha ) any one of them   -- > Add permissions  --- >  Attach existing policies directly
AMAZON s3 full access -- > add permissions ---- >

GROUP CONCEPT 
Lets create a group 
Then groups --- > group name ---EC2Group ---- > Attach policies --- > AmazonEC2FullAccess --- > Next --- > create group -- > 
Note : this is group is doesn’t have any users.
Then go to users ----- > Add user --- > user name --- > user1 --- >
Access type ---we select both
                              Programmatic     Access
                             AWS management console Access
                            Custom paswd :     user123@

NOTE :  -  We  are not select the reset passwd (remove tick mark)

Next --- > permissions -- >  Add users to group ---- >
Select the ----- > EC2GROUP --- > NEXT  --- > creat user   

  Then go to groups—select the Ec2 group --- > select the user1 --- > adduser

And  as  well  as  we  remove  the  user  also.

 

 
AWS services connected in to ways 
GUI (  graphical   user   interphase )
CLI (  command   line    interphase)

IAM ROLES CONCEPT

USE of role :   when one service is communicate with other service at that time we  are using  IAM  roles.
EX :           EC2 ----------------------------------- -----S3
                               Communicate with
Then create a one EC2 instance --- Allowed --- > all traffic ---- > create
Connted with git bash.(top)
Note : --- Now create one  role 
Then go  to  IAM Dash board --- > roles  --- > create role --- >
Select type of trusted entity     ----- . inthis -- we select -
- AWS SERVICE EC2 LAMBDA AND OTHERS ----- >Common use cases ----select ---------- -- EC2--------- > next permissions -- >
Note : Attach policies to the role
Attach permission policies -- >
---- > AmazonS3FullAccess --- > next -- > role name  ---  Myrole1
Role description  ALLOW EC2 instances to call service on your behalf
---- > create role   ---> 
Note :     This role having s3 full access
3  )  Attach role to EC2 machine

Then go EC2 dash board ---- > select the particular machine --- > actions  
--- >security ----- > modify IAM role --- > then select the myrole1 --- >save
Then create s3 bucket 
      aws s3 ls
it will be appear in git bash
then create one user
aws  iam  create-user    --user-name  test1
 note : we don’t have permissions to crate it .
then go --- >IAM --- > select the myrole 1 -- > Attach policies --- > IAMFullAccess     --- >attach policies 
NOW go to git bash
aws iam create-user    --user-name  test2
           it will work out 
  
then delete the role
