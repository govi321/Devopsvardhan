AWS CLI ON LINUX
UNDERSTANDING  IAM ROLES

AWS  CLI (command line interface)
To conncet from cli ,we need to provide access key and secret key .
Observation, in IAM dashboard , root access keys are deleted.

Generation of root access keys
Select  “delete your root access key ” ---  manage security credentials  --   > continue to security credentials .
Access keys (access key id secret  access key )  -- create  anew access key--- > show access key .download the key file --- >
Close.
	 Go to IAM dashboard-- >    top rightside   ----- >  Below the quick links----
- My access key--create new access key - show access key - then copy then  
Access key id :   AKIAWJTYJ6SEFJNWABM4
Secret access key :  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
As keys generated ,we can accesss to aws from cli.
We need to download  AND  install  aws cli tool.
Search for “Aws cli tool for windows ” in google
Select the first link  (docs.amazon.com)
Select “download the aws cli msi installer  for windows 64 bit ” 
Download and run the file .
Once the cli installed ,we can see it in control panel ---uninstall program we can see “aws command kine interface”

From the console,   create two bucket.(two bckets are created by gui type.)
We can see the list of bucket from command line .
Search in google  “aws s3 command”
Ex : aws s3 ls
Create one bucket in gui model and 
aws s3 ls 
We can see the bucket.

Now we are creating a one more bucket through 
CLI command .
            aws s3 mb s3://bucket-vardhan12345
mb means --- > make bucket
aws s3 ls
We can see the bucket console.
Upload the file in bucket.
aws s3 cp sample.txt s3://bucket-vardhan12345/ sample.txt1
Note : file does not exit 
Cause : File should be available in 
C:\WINDOWS\system32>
I want file should be available here.
Then upload one more time

aws s3 cp AADARCARD s3://bucket-vardhan12345/ AADARCARD1

  
createting user from command line	

search in google “aws iam command”

aws iam create-user  --user-name user-1
